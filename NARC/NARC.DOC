			Assembling NARC
			---------------

	There are two published versions of NARC. The first being the
normal 25kHz horizontal scan version (400x512). The second being the
interlaced 16kHz horizontal scan (400x512).

To Assemble 25kHz version:

	1) cd \VIDEO\NARC
	2) run "LOADIMG NARC1 /T"	;This will create the image tables	
	3) set INTERLACE = 0 in \VIDEO\SYS.INC	
	4) cd DIAG
	5) run "ALLDIAG"		;This will assemble the low level diag
	6) cd ..	
	7) run "ALLNARC"		;This will assemble and link the game
	8) done NARC.OUT is the executable object

To Assemble 16kHz version:

	1) cd \VIDEO\NARC
	2) run "LOADIMG NARC1 /T"	;This will create the image tables	
	3) set INTERLACE = 1 in \VIDEO\SYS.INC	
	4) cd DIAG
	5) run "ALLDIAG"		;This will assemble the low level diag
	6) cd ..	
	7) run "ALLNARC"		;This will assemble and link the game
	8) done NARC.OUT is the executable object
	

			Making ROMs for NARC
			--------------------

	Again there are two options when burning ROMs for NARC. The first
being the version for 27010 (1 Mbit) ROMs. The second is for the less
expensive 27512 (512 Kbit) ROMs.

To make 27010's:

	1) cd \VIDEO\NARC
	2) run MAKEROMS		;This will take you through all the steps.
		a) when in SYSCHECK.SET set ROM512 = 0
		b) copy DATAIO checksums for FC roms when given
		c) insert these checksums into ROMCHIPS.ASM when it appears. 
		   Also, set the FE checksums to FFFFh (this is important).
		d) copy DATAIO checksums for FE roms when given
		e) insert these checksums into ROMCHIPS.ASM when it appears. 
		f) calculate FE fudge bytes using FE checksums (see below).
		g) insert fudge bytes in an empty area of each FE rom.
		h) check final DATAIO checksums against theoretical(optional).
		i) burn NARCFC.0 (U42), NARCFC.1 (U24),
			NARCFE.0 (U41), NARCFE.1 (U23)  with PP
		j) done.

To make 27512's:

	1) cd \VIDEO\NARC
	2) run MAKER512		;This will take you through all the steps.
		a) when in SYSCHECK.SET set ROM512 = 1
		b) copy DATAIO checksums for F9, FA, and FD roms when given
		c) insert these checksums into ROMCHIPS.ASM when it appears. 
		   Also, set the FE checksums to FFFFh (this is important).
		d) copy DATAIO checksums for FE roms when given
		e) insert these checksums into ROMCHIPS.ASM when it appears. 
		f) calculate FE fudge bytes using FE checksums (see below).
		g) insert fudge bytes in an empty area of each FE rom.
		h) check final DATAIO checksums against theoretical(optional).
		i) burn NARCF9.0 (U78), NARCF9.1 (U60),
			NARCFA.0 (U77), NARCFA.1 (U59),
			NARCFC.0 (U42), NARCFC.1 (U24),
			NARCFE.0 (U41), NARCFE.1 (U23)	  with PP
		j) done.		


			Calculating FE fudge bytes
			--------------------------

	Using the two 16 bit DATAIO FE checksums that were inserted into
the file ROMCHIPS.ASM in place of the previously inserted FFFFh's, perform
these simple operations.

	1) Subtract the low bytes of each checksum from FFh.
	   These are the fudge bytes for NARCFE.0

	2) Subtract the high bytes of each checksum from FFh.
	   These are the fudge bytes for NARCFE.1


example:

	NARCFE.0 checksum = 0345h	NARCFE.1 checksum = 67ACh

	NARCFE.0 fudge bytes	       NARCFE.1 fudge bytes
	--------------------	       --------------------
	   FFh - 45h = BAh	          FFh - 03h = FCh
	   FFh - ACh = 53h	          FFh - 67h = 98h


			Reserved Fudge Byte Area
			------------------------

	With the NORTON utilities you can scan the ROM file for a copyright
message, "NARC COPYRIGHT (C) 1988 WILLIAMS ELECTRONICS GAMES, INC." In front
of this message should be four bytes all equal to 0. Feel free to use any
of these to insert the two fudge bytes. Yes, you can use the same NORTON
utility to find the area and insert the fudge bytes.


That is all and have a nice day. (GNP - 7/31/89)
