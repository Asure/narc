   Controls
   --------
	Joystick  - Moves the player up/down/left/right.

	A	  - Holding down this button will make the player fire
		    bullets continuously.
		    A short click will make him fire a Rocket Bomb.

	B	  - Holding down this button will make the player crouch.
		    A short click will make him jump.

        Start	  - Freezes game action.	

	Select    - Nothing.


	   The jumping and Rocket Bombing are very difficult.  The program
	does not seem to handle these very well at times of heavy action.
	Firing a single bullet also proves to be very difficult.

	   I found that I could overcome the control problems for most of
	the game. However, trying to kill Mr. Big in the wheelchair is
	very hard because you must crouch and fire a rocket at the same
	time.

   Overall
   -------
	- Some of the background artwork is not up to par.

	- Player that is behind (in two player mode) should catch up
	  to the one that is ahead.

	- Only one type of Das Lof Gang enemy appears. There are no
	  red (fast), blue (carries rockets), or green (lays and fires).

	- Crouched player should NOT be hit by standing Das Lof Gang enemies.

	- Lofs that are about to be busted then get away should walk longer
	  before they turn and fire.

	- Busted enemies should drop loot (money, drugs, bullets ...).

	- There should be an immeadiate score given for busting an enemy.

	- Loot at edge of screen cannot be picked up.

	- Dogs are relentless! They should give a break to a guy who has
	  just died.

	- Chopper should drop drugs when it is shot down.

	- 25,000 points should be awarded each player for destroying all
	  of the glassware in the K.R.A.K. Stop.

	- Picking up loot while driving the car should be easier.	

	- Why aren't the dumpsters moveable?

	- Not enough cars show up on the driving wave. It takes too long	
	  to get another one after you have blown yours up.

	- Dumpster man should explode if he walks over a mine.

	- Dumpster man should always be aggresive. He is not if you enter
	  his area on foot.

	- Driving wave, overall, needs more enemies.

	- Pimps should be bustable.

	- Pimp artwork is very bad.

	- In the Scrap Heap, where you pick-up the Silver Safe Card, you
	  should not be able to walk to the end until you kill all of the
	  Dumpster men.

	- Sgt. Skyhigh is a boring enemy. Make him attack in Y also.
	
	- Cash Machine on the Big Bank should spit out $$$ if you are
	  holding the Green Safe Card.

	- H.Q. Posse enemies should move in formation. Currently they are	
	  just like the smart Das Lof Gang enemy.

	- H.Q. Posse artwork is worse than the pimp.

	- H.Q. Posse, some members should fire rockets at the player, if
	  they are carrying them.


   I made it as far as the Mr. Big in the wheelchair.  I shot him out once
   and that was the end.  I feel that this cartridge is a very excellent
   interpretation of the arcade game.  It's fun to play and very challenging.
   I sincerely hope that some of my suggestions are implemented so as to
   improve the quality of the product.
