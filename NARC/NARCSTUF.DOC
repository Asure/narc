Things to do on NARC
--------------------

x Make player jump hang time longer, this needs to be a playable feature.
  Also fix bug, holding weapon select while moving, then left off the
  joystick, player velocity is not zero'd.

x Flame Thrower even extension, there's quite a jump from short to long.
  If player switches direction, switch Flamer for him.

x Have Loffredo enemies carry different weapons, when you kill him his
  weapon falls to the ground. Certain enemies should carry drugs and or money
  these guys will look as if they're going somewhere, the player must chase
  them in order to get their stache. Surrendering?

- Background area maps, a routine which returns a code pertaining to what
  an object is standing in (i.e. 0=solid surface, 1 = opening).

x Find a way not to use the interrupt pending flag, if possible.

x Add player/enemy collision with background objects in the movement routines.

x Do text string output routines.

- Driver scoring: Driver hit by explosion(lowest score), driver hit by bullet
  from the front(middle score), driver hit by bullet from behind(next),
  finally, driver hit by rocket is the highest scoring.

- Loffredo needs to shoot while laying down, the major velocity to his jump.

x Add the whore snatcher.

x Add Dumpster man.

x Add the sewer dude.

x Possibly use a different collision routine for player bullets, no Z detect.
